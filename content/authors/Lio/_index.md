## Background

Hi my name is **Lio**. I'm your friendly Pwner from **HCMC University of Technology**.

I used to be a noob game developer. Now I'm just a hecker ~~with skill issue~~ when night falls.

Absolutely love anime-related stuffs. Part-time weeaboo when dawn breaks.

My favorite number is 1767991380. Bet you can decode this (not my social security number btw).

In the meantime, BKISC{L1f3_1t_53lF_i5_4_t7p3_0f_5k1ll_i55u3}.
