## Background

My name is **Dang Le**, also known under my nickname **midas** or **lkmidas**. I'm currently a Research Intern at Northwestern University under the supervision of Dr. Xinyu Xing. Before this, I received my B.Eng in Computer Engineering from Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology in 2022. My current research focus is Kernel Security and a bit of Smart Contract Security. I'm also doing a bit of Reverse Engineering on my own time. In my undergraduate days, I participated in many CTF competitions and achieved several national and international prizes, my main CTF categories were Pwn and RE. Nowadays, I don't really try hard CTFs for ranking, just play for fun when I have time.
