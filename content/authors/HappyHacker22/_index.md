## About me

I am ***HappyHacker22***. I have been a member of [BKISC](https://bkisc.com) since July 2022, focusing on my studies in Cryptography during that time. I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering in November 2024 and am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science, which I expect to complete in 2026. I plan to continue my academic journey by obtaining a PhD in 2030.

My specialty is ***Cryptography***, with primary interests in ***Zero-Knowledge Proofs***, ***Functional Encryption***, and ***Lattice-based Cryptography***. I also enjoy exploring the cryptographic aspects of ***Blockchain technology***.
