## About me

Hi, I am hah4 (Anh-Hung Hoang), a web pentester from BKISC. Currently, I am studying Computer Science at Ho Chi Minh University of Technology.

Started as a Back-End developer, I have developed many applications. Because of many requirements in security, I have learned about threats and vulnerabilities. I suddenly realized that I have a passion for hacking, and my road to become a cyber security specialist began since.
